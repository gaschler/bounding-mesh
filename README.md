Boundingmesh is a library and tool set for generating *bounding meshes and
 bounding convex decompositions*.
A bounding mesh encloses a given mesh and has fewer vertices; it
 is single-sided approximate mesh.
A bounding convex decomposition is a set of convex hulls of few vertices
that enclose a given mesh.

## Usage

### License
Boundingmesh itself is under the permissive 2-clause BSD license.
However, it may use the following open source software libraries,
which have other licenses: [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/),
[EigenQP](https://github.com/wingsit/QP),
[Coin3D](https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/coin/wiki/Home),
[Qt](https://www.qt.io/licensing/), [SOLID](http://dtecta.com/licence/index.html),
[SoQt](https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/soqt), [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/license.html).
Please find their source code and licenses on their respective websites.
By default, EigenQP is compiled into Boundingmesh and LGPL applies unless
you deactivate the option `USE_EIGENQUADPROG`.
For instance, if you compile convex decomposition,
CGAL components are linked whose GPL license applies to the rest of the code.

### Installation

#### Dependencies
We rely on the linear algebra library [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) for most computations.  
If you perform loading of `.wrl` files, you also need the [Coin3D](https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/coin/wiki/Home) toolkit.  
The included GUI application also requires __QT4__ and __SoQT4__.  
The modules involving convex bodies rely on [QHull](http://www.qhull.org/) and [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/).

#### Building from Source
We provide a CMake build file. We recommend building by

    mkdir Release
    cd Release
    cmake ..
    make

#### Binaries
Windows binaries may be included in the [releases](//github.com/gaschler/bounding-mesh/releases).

### Command-Line Tools

#### Bounding Mesh Simplification
Bounding meshes can be generated with a command-line executable. The interface is as follows:

    ./boundingmesh [options] FilenameIn [FilenameOut]

*   FileIn (required): The path of the mesh file thats is to be simplified. The filename extension has to indicate one of the supported file formats `.off`, `.obj`, `.stl` or `.wrl`. Loading `.wrl` files requires the Coin library to be available.
*   FileOut (optional): The path where the resulting mesh will be stored. The filename extension determines the written format that has to be one of `.off`, `.obj`, `.stl` or `.wrl`. Defaults to `boundingmesh_[FileIn]`.

*   --direction, -d: Direction of the simplification. `Inward`, `Outward` or `Any`.
*   --vertices, -v: The target number of vertices. 
*   --error, -e: The maximum error an edge contraction may introduce.
*   --metric, -m: The metric generation algorithm to be used. Available choices: `QEM_Classic`, `QEM_Modified`, `MinConstant`, `Diagonalization`, `Average`. 
*   --init, -i: The initialization algorithm of merge-based algorithms. Available choices: `Midpoint`, `DistancePrimitives`. 
*   --faceset: If the input format is .wrl, only the faceset with this number is loaded. Supply the index as an 0-indexed integer.
*   --colored: If the output format is .wrl, disconnected submeshes will be assigned distinct colors. No arguments taken.

#### Bounding Convex Decomposition
Bounding convex decompositions can be generated with the following command-line executable:

    ./bounding-convex-decomposition [options] filename [filename_out.wrl]

*   filename: Input file may be of type .off, .obj, .stl or .wrl
*   --voxels, -x: Number of voxels to be used, a good value is 200000. Higher numbers increase quality and computation time.
*   --alpha, -a: Parameter alpha, default is 1. Increases the number of splits into convex bodies.
*   --error, -e: The maximum error that may be introduced by the bounding mesh post-processing step.
Relative to the bounding box diagonal length. (Convex decomposition usually introduces a much
higher error than the bounding mesh approximation.)

### GUI Application

The application providing the graphical user interface is built from the files located in`src/boundingmesh-gui/`. 
The filenames of the binaries are respectively 

    ./boundingmesh-gui

or 
    boundingmesh-gui.exe

Building the boundingmesh software including the GUI requires the additional dependencies __Coin3, QT4, and SoQT4__ to be installed.

The GUI enables easy selection of the various decimation configurations. It shows the current mesh detail and allows interactive simplification. Contraction can be started for a single edge or batches of 100 or 5000 edges at a time. Furthermore, simplification down to a certain vertex count or error limit can be started.

#### Linux Build

Most build dependencies are available with the most common distributions.
In Ubuntu, you can install them with the command

    sudo apt-get install build-essentials cmake-curses-gui libcoin60-dev libeigen3-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev libsoqt4-dev libqhull6 libqhull-dev

#### Windows Build

For Windows, we recommend to find the required libraries
on the [Robotics Library Website](http://roboticslibrary.org).
Boundingmesh requires a subset of the dependencies the 
Robotics Library requires, so the build instructions from there
apply to large extent.

### Static Library

Boundingmesh provides a static C++ library that can be used from other software.

We provide a central header:

    #include <boundingmesh.h>

The build process will create the static library `libboundingmesh.a` to be linked against your program.

A minimal example that loads a mesh from an `.off` file, simplifies it until it has 1000 or less vertices, and saves the result:

    #include <boundingmesh.h> 
    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
		boundingmesh::Mesh mesh;
		mesh.loadOff("mesh.off");
		boundingmesh::Decimator decimator;
		decimator.setDirection(boundingmesh::Outward);
		decimator.setMaximumError(1);
		decimator.setTargetVertices(1000);
		decimator.setMesh(mesh);
		std::shared_ptr<boundingmesh::Mesh> sp_result_mesh
		sp_result_mesh->writeOff("mesh_simplified.off");
		return 0;
    };

The following documentation describes the complete library and gives brief explanations of the provided functionality.

## Code Guide

The following is a rough textual description of the control flow of the programs and algorithms. Hopefully it eases the familiarization with the codebase.

### Data Structures

The primitives to represent 3D geometry are declared in [boundingmesh/Primitives.h](#boundingmeshprimitvesh). Vertices, edges and triangles all store their local neighbourhood. Referencing is always done through __Indices__ that are valid within the mesh.  
For example, assume you want to iterate through the adjacent vertices of one vertex. This is done by iterating over the adjacent triangles (their indices) and retrieving the triangle data to get the vertex indices.  
Meshes can be loaded from a few file formats, which all extract vertex and triangle data encoded in some way. The vertices are added to the `Mesh` object and connected to form triangles. Vertex insertion is done through a proxy class `VertexPositionSet` which unifies vertices with equal coordinates (by checking if a vertex with the same coordinates exists).  
Removal of vertices, triangles... is deferred, marking the deleted objects until a call to `Mesh::cleanAndRenumber()` is made.

### Mesh Decimation

Mesh decimation begins with the configuration of a `Decimator`. Besides setting parameters to select the error metric or the stopping criterion this also includes the selection of the mesh to process. This configuration prepares the decimation queue for the main algorithm by evaluating all edges of the mesh.  
The core decimation algorithm is located in `Decimator::compute()` and just repeatedly picks the best modification.  
The modification of the mesh is done in `Decimator::executeEdgeContraction()`. This method uses information about which parts have to be removed or reconnected collected in `Decimator::collectRemovalData()`.  
The scoring of contractions (and simultaneously the selection of inserted points) is done in `Decimator::computeEdgeContraction()` by minimizing cost functions. A cost function is represented by a matrix, which is computed in the [`MetricGenerator`](#boundingmeshmetricgeneratorh) class depending on the settings.

### Convex Decomposition

The convex decomposition algorithm starts by rasterizing the mesh into a voxel model or `VoxelSet`.  
The voxel set is then repeatedly divided by collecting the voxels on the two sides of a plane into different subsets (methods `SegmenterSimple::compute()` and `VoxelSubset::partition()`).
The resulting subsets of voxels are then used to generate convex bodies, by collecting the points of the mesh that produced the voxels (method `VoxelSubset::calculateConvexHull()`).

## Documentation

The whole library is contained in the namespace `boundingmesh`. Add it to your program by including `boundingmesh.h` and linking against `libboundingmesh.a`.  
The source code is written mostly conforming to the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).

### Command-line tool
####`boundingmesh-bin/main.cpp`

`int main(int argc, char** argv)`

    Adds a new vertex to the mesh.
*   `Index addTriangle(Index vertex1, Index vertex2, Index vertex3)`  
    Adds a new triangle to the mesh. Requires the three given indices to be valid.

Removal methods keep the mesh consistent, removing all references to the deleted object and deleting
empty objects (i.e. edges whose triangles were removed). Be careful when accessing the mesh data after removal 
as they leave the mesh in a dirty state.

*   `Index registerEdge(Index vertex1, Index vertex2, Index triangle)`  
    Registers a new edge within the mesh.
*   `void cleanAndRenumber()`  
    Perfoms the deferred removal of vertices and triangles. A call to `removeVertex()` or `removeTriangle()` only marks them for later removal and removes all references to the index from the mesh. `cleanAndRenumber()` removes the data and calculates new indices.

*   `Index edge() const`  
    Returns the index of the edge to be contracted.
*   `Vector new_point() const`  
    Returns the position of the new point that will be inserted into the mesh instead.

    Compares two contractions by their cost.

##### `class ContractionIndex`
Helper class to access contractions in the `ContractionQueue` by edge index. 

*   `ContractionIndex(Index index)`  
    Creates a contraction index containing only an edge index (but no iterator to a contraction). Used for finding the corresponding contraction.

    Inserts a contraction into the queue. Also internally creates the contraction index to access the contraction by edge index.
*   `void remove(Index edge)`  
    Removes the contraction of the edge with index `edge` from the queue.
